# esp8266-ADNS3080-Supertrack
Goal is to build a high speed, low latency, 2D or 3D tracking system for low weight robotic systems.

Based on the ESP8266 as the computing core and ADNS3080 for high speed image capture.

#Idea is to use similar techniques an algorithms as been used in the laser distance project.
